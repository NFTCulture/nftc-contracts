/**
 * @title NFTCPaymentSplitterBase
 * @author @NiftyMike | @NFTCulture
 * @dev An opinionated replacement of OZ's Payment Splitter.
 *
 * Notes:
 *  - Based on OZ Contracts v4.8.0 (finance/PaymentSplitter.sol)
 *  - ERC-20 token functionality removed to save gas.
 *  - Transferability of Payees, but only by Payee
 *  - Some require messages are shortened.
 *  - contract changed to abstract and release() functionality moved to internal method.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: changes to release() require higher level classes to expose release() in order
 * for funds to be withdrawn. This allows higher level classes to enforce better controls.
